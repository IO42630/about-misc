* 1-3 are local.
* 1-4 may be called trees.

| 1 | Working Directory | > "physical" directory in which repo was initialized. +

> `add <file>` adds a file to index.

| `2 -> 3` | `commit`
| `3 -> 4` | `push <origin> <branch>`
| `3 <- 4` | `fetch`

== Std Commands and their Workflows

{empty} +

=== init / clone
[cols="2,10"]
|===
| `git clone` | `git init` +
`git remote add origin URL` +
`git fetch --all` +
`git pull origin master` +
(additionally `clone` will setup additional  remote tracking branches)
|===

* git clone https://github.com/IO42630/idea-settings.git



{empty} +

=== add / commit

===== Workflow
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| `touch foo.txt` | create a file
| `git add foo.txt` | stage file
| `git commit foo.txt -m "foo was added"` | commit file with msg "foo was added" +
> will return error, if prior `add` was omitted

|===

{empty} +

=== branch

A branch is 'just' a pointer to a commit.
I.e. creating a branch does not modify the repo in any other way.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| `git branch` | list local branches located in `.git/refs/heads`
| `git branch -r` | list remote branches located in `.git/refs/remotes`
| `git branch -a` | list all branches in local and remote repo
| `git branch <feature>` | create new branch called <feature>.
| `git branch -d <feature>` | safe delete branch (only if no unmerged changes present)
| `git branch -D <feature>` | force delete
| `git branch -m <foo>` | rename current branch to <foo>
| `git checkout <feature>` | switches to branch <feature>
|===

===== Workflow
|===
| git branch foo |
| git checkout foo |
|===

{empty} +
{empty} +

=== fetch
|===
| `git remote add <feature> <path>` | Create alias for url or path.
| origin | auto-generated alias for url where repo was cloned from
| `git remote rename <old-name> <new-name` | remotes can be renamed
| `git fetch` | downloads content from remote repo

|===

{empty} +

=== merge
[cols="2,4,4"]
|===
| merging branch | branch being merged | here <repo-feature>/<feature>
| receiving branch | branch receiving the merge | here <repo-local>/<master>
|===

===== Workflow
The following cmd are performed from within the <repo-local> repo, thus the receiving branch.

[options=header,cols="8,16"]
|===
| command  | effect
| `git status` |  check if HEAD is pointing to <master>.
| `git checkout <master>` | switch to <master> if HEAD was pointing elsewhere in `git status` .
| `git fetch <repo-feature>` | fetch (store a copy) latest changes

| `git merge <feature>/<branch>` | merge feature into <master>
| `git pull <remote> <master>` | combines `fetch` + `merge`
|===

=== Git in IDEA
* in log, only the remote branches without a local counterpart are shown.

=== ignore
Both `.gitignore` and `.git/info/exclude` invoke the same mechanism.
[options=header,cols="8,16"]
|===
|   |

| `.git/info/exclude` | meant for personal ignore patterns.
