=== Considerations
* Win is needed for driver support of RAID and GPU.
* Win is generally unstable and unreliable.
* All files and data will be kept on VirtualBox / Linux.
* Do not mount to Win.
* All consumer activity will be done in Linux
* All dev activity will happen in Win

=== File Systems

Context/Intent: +
We want one git-annex archive called `pool`. +
Further we want >=2 limited copies called `home`. +
Limited means that we exclude media content, and keep a limited version history.

Generally we have:

* Windows host system, referred to as Win.
* A Linux VM, named `zeed`.

{empty} +

The Result are the following file systems:

* `pool`
** Win ReFS 2-way mirror across 8 HDDs, mounted on `P:\`
**  10 `vdmk` (`P:\pool1\pool1.vdmk` to `P:\pool10\pool10.vdmk`)
*** divided into 1000 scalable chunks of 2GB each
**** thus eventually we will need 40 TB of storage to keep up.
**** as of 12.02.22 we have 18 TB connected, and 3.62 TB used.
** the `vdmk` are mounted as one `zfs` to `zeed` at `\pool`
** `pool` serves as archive as not meant to be mounted to Win.

{empty} +

* `home` (@define)
** 1 `vdmk` at `C:\Users\user\vms\zeed\media_home.vdmk`
*** divided into 100 scalable chunks of 2GB each
** the `vdmk` is mounted to `\media\home`
** exposed to Win through `\\sshfs:r\user@192.168.1.122\media\home` at `H:\`

{empty} +

* `home` (@panda)
** WIP
** on notebook
** meant to mirror home@define

{empty} +

* `share` (@define)
** if we want to easily move some files between Win and `zeed` we can use `share`
** mounted on `C:\Users\user\home\share` and `/media/share`

==== Exceptions
The following data is excluded this "File System":

* SMTP -> managed by Thunderbird
* ~\app -> OS specific
* ~\ws -> managed by Git
